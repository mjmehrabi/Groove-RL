 * following phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Creation (constructor call). At this time nothing is known about the
 * ordering of search items in the search plan, so nothing is known about
 * already found or pre-matched parts.
 * <li> Activation (call of {@link #activate(PlanSearchStrategy)}). At this
 * time the ordering of the items is known, and indices for the parts can be
 * obtained, as well as knowledge about which parts are already found.
 * <li> Record creation (call of {@link #createRecord(Search)}).
 * At this time the pre-matched images are known. Found images are also known,
 * but are due to change at subsequent finds.
 * <li> Record usage (call of {@link Record#next()}). At this time the found
 * images are known.
