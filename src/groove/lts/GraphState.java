/**
 * Combination of graph and node functionality, used to store the state of a
 * graph transition system.
 * States store the outgoing rule transitions, but not the recipe transitions:
 * these can be calculated by the GTS.
 * Every graph state has a <i>status</i>, consisting of the following boolean
 * flags:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Closed:</b> A graph state is closed if all rule applications have been explored.
 * <li> <b>Cooked:</b> A graph state is done if it is closed and all reachable states up
 * until the first non-transient states are also closed. This means that all outgoing
 * transitions (including recipe transitions) are known.
 * <li> <b>Transient:</b> A graph state is transient if it is an intermediate state in
 * the execution of a recipe.
 * <li> <b>Absent:</b> A graph state is absent if it is done and transient and does not
 * have a path to a non-transient state, or violates a right
 * application condition.
 * <li> <b>Error:</b> A graph state is erroneous if it fails to satisfy an invariant
 * </ul>
 * A derived concept is:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Present:</b> A graph state is (definitely) present if it is done and not absent.
 * (Note that this is <i>not</i> strictly the inverse of being absent: a raw state
 * is neither present nor absent.
 * </ul>
