 * following conventions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For a signature named "zzz", the Java interface name should be
 * <code>ZzzSignature</code>
 * <li>The signature should define a single sort <code>Zzz</code>; the sort name
 * should be a type parameter
 * <li>If other data sorts are needed, they should also be declared as type
 * parameters
 * <li>For each such additional type parameter <code>Yyy</code>, there should be
 * a corresponding class <code>YyySignature</code>
 * <li>There is no overloading of the methods in a signature
